# PDF-Noise-Classification

To decrease the time taken by a manual pre-OCR pdf labeling process. I built a CNN image classification model using OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras in Python using Jyputer Notebooks. The CNN model classifies PDFs according to the amount of noise, 1 - representing very high noise and 5 - representing clear pdfs.
